# Crowdcoin


## Introduction

To Increase Transparency and Prevent Fraudulent Activities that arise around the world of StartUps and Platforms that have till now been developed around it such as Kickstarter. Although stringent measures such as symmetric encryption are in place to make e-payment safe and secure, it is still vulnerable to hacking. Enterprises with in-house e-payment systems must incur additional costs in procuring, installing and maintaining sophisticated payment-security technologies. There is no guarantee that people who post projects on Kickstarter will deliver on their projects, use the money to implement their projects, or that the completed projects will meet backers' expectations. A mockup of KickStarter built using smart contracts written in solidity. The app is built using Reactjs with the help of Nextjs.
